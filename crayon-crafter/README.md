### Crayon Crafter
Project Description: A web application that allows users to create personalized crayon boxes by selecting colors from an external color API and organizes these crayons into boxes of 8. The app aims to provide an engaging and creative experience for users, while solving the problem of a lack of color varieties in crayon packs that exists on the market.
